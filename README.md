## Aitotal

This program is designed to check files for malware on the service https://www.virustotal.com

This program checks files on VirusTotal.com and displays the result. **This program does not replace antiviruses**.

- Drag & drop files/folders on a running program.

To stop the checking, press the "Stop" button.
